# n8n_experiments
This repository demonstrates event-driven public health workflows using n8n. It implements pregnancy screening, doctor referral, patient notification, and follow-up task automation, along with immunization and chronic care flows. The focus is on reusable workflow blocks, policy-based routing, and decoupled orchestration across health systems.
